# Custom User Profiles

The scripts in this folder creates individualized user profiles similar to those found [here](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/46304). In this bare bones version, plots are made in R and aggregated in a HTML page. An example report can be seen by clicking on report.html in the current directory.


## Requirements
- R (scripts were written under version 3.2.4).
- The R graphics package, ggplot2 
- Python 2.7

## Installation
To copy files from this repository into a directory of your choice, run the following command. This will create a folder named `codeforces-api` in the current directory. Scripts for visualizing a user's statistics are in the `ui` folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/yjiao/codeforces-api
```


R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). To install ggplot2 in R, type `R` in terminal to open the commandline interface for R, and enter the following:

```
install.packages('ggplot2')
```


## Usage

Generate your report:

```
cd path-to-folder/codeforces-api/ui
chmod +x createReport.sh
./createReport.sh --handle=yourCodeforcesHandle
```
`path-to-folder` is the path to the folder you ran the `git clone` command in. `yourCodeforcesHandle` is the handle you use on codeforces.

View report:

```
open report.html
```

This will automatically update problem and user data, if new problems have been published on codeforces between runs. Note calculating problem ratings can be a bit slow depending on the number of contests elapsed between runs--this is limited by the speed of codeforces api. Usually tens of competitions will run in a few minutes.
